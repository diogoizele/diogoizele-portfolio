            Hi, my name is Diogo Gabriel Izele, I&apos;m 20 years old and my job is
            to create cool stuff for the web. Since 2015, I really enjoy
            creating content for the internet, which has given me good design
            bases for editing images and videos. A little older, I became even
            more interested in computing, starting in 2019 the technical course
            in computing at IFSUL. I am currently studying Computer Science at
            Unisinos - POA.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since programming started to be part of my daily life, my main focus
            has been creating Frontends for web pages and applications, but I
            also have experience with other aspects such as Backend and Mobile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently my goal is to become a full-stack developer, being an
            expert in all parts of the web development process, being able to
            work in all sides and with the main technologies used by the market.
